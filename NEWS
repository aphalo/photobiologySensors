photobiologySensors 0.2.0
=========================

Added the spectral data generously supplied as a file by sglux for their sensors.
Rebuilt all data objects and data .r files with photobiology 0.5.7 which is now required.
Editted the vignettes to use the high level functions currently available in the suite.
As a result the code for the example calculations is now much simpler, and
consequently, hopefully, also much easier to understand for the user.

photobiologySensors 0.1.8
=========================

Rebuilt data object and data .r files and fixed one example in docs.
Fixed bugs that rendered data for some sensors inaccessible.

photobiologySensors 0.1.7
=========================

Added data for Thies sensor and modified automatic data objects build to use response.spct objects.

photobiologySensors 0.1.6
=========================

Fixed a bug that surfaced after trim_tails was modified to allow extrapolation. Cleaned the vignettes.

photobiologySensors 0.1.5
=========================

Added more spectra for sglux TOCON sensors.
Vignette of spectra updated to include the new data and plotting adjusted a little.

photobiologySensors 0.1.4
=========================

Vignette of spectra now shows peaks.

photobiologySensors 0.1.3
=========================

Added data for Solar Light and Vital Technologies sensors from WMO-STUK intercomparison. Data kindly made available by Lasse Ylianttila (STUK). First version of User Guide.

photobiologySensors 0.1.2
=========================

Calc_sensor_multipliers bug fixed. Sensor data files cleaned. Vignette now builds correctly.

photobiologySensors 0.1.1
=========================

Added Solarmeter MODEL 6.0 UV meter.

photobiologySensors 0.1.0
=========================

First version. Includes response spectra for sensors for which we have found data online.
