#' UVS-B-T Radiometer
#' The detection system includes optical filters and a phosphor
#' that determine the spectral response. The phosphor is very
#' sensitive to low levels of ultraviolet radiation and is stimulated
#' by the UV to emit green light, which is detected by a photodiode.
#' The system is temperature stabilised at +25 Â°C to prevent
#' changes in spectral response and sensitivity with variations in
#' the ambient conditions.
