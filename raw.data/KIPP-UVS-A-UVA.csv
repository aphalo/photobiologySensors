#' UVS-A-T Radiometer.
#' The detection system includes optical filters and a phosphor
#' that determine the spectral response. The phosphor is very
#' sensitive to low levels of ultraviolet radiation and is stimulated
#' by the UV to emit green light, which is detected by a photodiode.
#' The system is temperature stabilised at +25 Â°C to prevent
#' changes in spectral response and sensitivity with variations in
#' the ambient conditions.
#' Digitized with 'enguage' from manufacturers brochures. This are approximate
#' data, both because of the digitizing process, and because they are
#' either typical values or for a particular sensor unit. Individual sensor units
#' are expected to differ to some degree in spectral response.
