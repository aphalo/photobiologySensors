#' LI-200SA pyranometer.
#' The LI-200SA features a silicon photovoltaic detector. 
#' This is not a true 'pyranometer' and should be used only in sunlight, and calibarted in sunlight.
#' Digitized with 'enguage' from manufacturers brochures. This are approximate
#' data, both because of the digitizing process, and because they are
#' either typical values or for a particular sensor unit. Individual sensor units
#' are expected to differ to some degree in spectral response.
