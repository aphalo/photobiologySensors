#' LI-210SA PHOTOMETRIIC SENSOR.
#' The LI-210SA Photometric Sensor utilizes a filtered silicon photodiode to provide
#' a spectral response that matches the CIE curve within Â± 5% with most light sources.
#' Digitized with 'enguage' from manufacturers brochures. This are approximate
#' data, both because of the digitizing process, and because they are
#' either typical values or for a particular sensor unit. Individual sensor units
#' are expected to differ to some degree in spectral response.
