#' @description
#' Datasets containing the wavelengths (nm) at either regular or irregular intervals and
#' tabulated values of spectral responsiveness for different sensors.
#' Spectral response values are in relative energy or photon spectral responsivity units.
#'
#' The variables are as follows, but only one of s.e.response or s.q.response is included:
#' \itemize{
#'   \item w.length (nm)
#'   \item s.e.response (a.u.)
#'   \item s.q.respone (a.u.)
#' }

#' @note
#' The LI-210SA Photometric Sensor utilizes a filtered silicon photodiode to provide
#' a spectral response that matches the CIE curve within Â± 5% with most light sources.
#' Digitized with 'enguage' from manufacturers brochures. This are approximate
#' data, both because of the digitizing process, and because they are
#' either typical values or for a particular sensor unit. Individual sensor units
#' are expected to differ to some degree in spectral response.
