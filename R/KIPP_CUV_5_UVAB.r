#' @description Datasets containing the wavelengths (nm) at either regular or
#' irregular intervals and tabulated values of spectral responsiveness for
#' different sensors (in most cases spectral data are normalized to one at the
#' wavelength of maximum energy responsivity).
#'
#' The variables are as follows, but only one of s.e.response or s.q.response is
#' included:
#' \itemize{
#'    \item w.length (nm)
#'    \item s.e.response (a.u.)
#' }

#' @title Kipp CUV 5 Broadband UV Radiometer.
#'
#' @note
#' Detection system includes optical filters and a photodiode.
#' Digitized with 'enguage' from manufacturers brochures. This are approximate
#' data, both because of the digitizing process, and because they are
#' either typical values or for a particular sensor unit. Individual sensor units
#' are expected to differ to some degree in spectral response.
