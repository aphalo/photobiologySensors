#' @description
#' Datasets containing the wavelengths (nm) at either regular or irregular intervals and
#' tabulated values of spectral responsiveness for different sensors.
#' Spectral response values are in relative energy or photon spectral responsivity units.
#'
#' The variables are as follows, but only one of s.e.response or s.q.response is included:
#' \itemize{
#'   \item w.length (nm)
#'   \item s.e.response (a.u.)
#'   \item s.q.respone (a.u.)
#' }

#' @note
#' Spectral data digitized from figure in manufacturer's manual.
#' This is typical measured data, and for specific sensor units the
#' calibration data supplied with the sensor must be used as individual
#' may differ in their spectral response. Furthermore, the digigitizing
#' process from figures with a linear scale is prone to errors, which
#' are specially noticeable in regions of low responsivity.
