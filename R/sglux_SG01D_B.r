#' @description Datasets containing the wavelengths (nm) at either regular or
#' irregular intervals and tabulated values of spectral responsiveness for
#' different sensors (in most cases spectral data are normalized to one at the
#' wavelength of maximum energy responsivity).
#'
#' The variables are as follows, but only one of s.e.response or s.q.response is
#' included:
#' \itemize{
#'    \item w.length (nm)
#'    \item s.e.response (a.u.)
#' }

#' @title sglux SG01D-B UV-B broadband sensor
#' @note
#' UV-B broadband sensor (filtered SiC sensor, VIS-blind).
#' Original data supplied by the manufacturer as a computer readable file.
#' This is typical measured data. Individual sensor units
#' are expected to differ to a small degree in spectral response.
