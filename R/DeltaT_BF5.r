#' @description Datasets containing the wavelengths (nm) at either regular or
#' irregular intervals and tabulated values of spectral responsiveness for
#' different sensors (in most cases spectral data are normalized to one at the
#' wavelength of maximum energy responsivity).
#'
#' The variables are as follows, but only one of s.e.response or s.q.response is
#' included:
#' \itemize{
#'    \item w.length (nm)
#'    \item s.e.response (a.u.)
#' }

#' @note
#' Spectral data digitized from figure in manufacturer's manual.
#' This is typical measured data, and for specific sensor units the
#' calibration data supplied with the sensor must be used as individual
#' units may differ in their spectral response. Furthermore, the digigitizing
#' process from figures with a linear scale is prone to errors, which
#' are specially noticeable in regions of low responsivity.
