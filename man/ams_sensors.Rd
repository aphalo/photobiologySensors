\details{
TSL254R light-to-voltage optical sensor combining a photodiode
and a transimpedance amplifier, sold as electronic components.
The spectral response is nearly identical
for type TSL250, TSL251 and TSL252.  (part is no longer in production.)

TSL257 high-sensitivity low-noise light-to-voltage optical
converter that combines a photodiode and a transimpedance amplifier,
sold as electronic components.

AS7263, AS7331, AS7341, AS7343, TSL2501 are miniature multichannel sensors
in SMD packages. In addition to photodiodes and optical filters they contain
analogue signal amplifiers and analogue to digital conversion circuits. The
data are returned digitally through an I2C serial interface. In some of them
analogue gain and ADC integration time can be set through the I2C interface.

\note{
Digitized with 'DigitizeIt' from manufacturers data sheets. This are
approximate data, both because of the digitizing process, and because they
are either typical values or for a specific sensor unit. Individual sensor
units are expected to differ to some degree in spectral response. In the case
of multichannel sensors, the spectra for all channels are plotted in the same
figure in the data sheets and in out-of-band regions the lines overlap making
accurate extraction of values very difficult. Variation from unit to unit
affects both response and center/peak wavelengths.
